# English proficiency
## Overview
This project attempts to build a functional English proficiency test from a sparse dataset consisting of user interactions with multiple choice questions. It began by exploring and refining the available data, moved on to proving that a machine learning model can predict proficiency based on that data, then culminated (for the purposes of this repository) in the deployment of a [Web application](https://mln-alpha.web.app/).

This repository is a capstone project deliverable for the [Udacity Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/school-of-data-science). All work was done by Evan Quinlan, including data analysis, data pipeline construction, Web application development, and Web application deployment, during enrollment in the nanodegree program. Work was done while employed by Transparent Language, the proprietor of the data, and is shared publicly and submitted to Udacity with permission of Transparent Language.

## Problem
While I was enrolled in the nanodegree program, a unique data science problem fell into my lap that fit the requirements for a capstone project.

The CEO of the company I work for, [Transparent Language](https://www.transparent.com/), wanted to know if an English proficiency test could be created based on data generated by the company's English language game [_Which Is English?_](https://whichisenglish.transparent.com/). The game asks players to answer binary questions about the English language, then provides them with a score, which may be posted on a leaderboard. A good score, however, doesn't necessarily reflect true English knowledge, since players may have memorized answers or sped through the game to increase their points. The CEO did not want to devote "official" company resources to this endeavor, so he allowed me to pursue it personally and in an "unofficial" capacity, agreeing to let me share the work as long as I respected proprietary company information.

The question is, **Can data generated by the game form the basis of an English proficiency test?** And moreover, can this be done more efficiently than traditional [computerized adaptive testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing) techniques would allow?

What "proficiency test" means to some may differ wildly from what it means to others, but in its broadest sense, it is a series of questions (preferably adaptive) which, after being answered (or skipped, as allowed), indicate the degree of some relative, latent ability in the test-taker. The test need only measure _some kind of English language ability_, so the answer does not depend on testing all four major language skills, namely reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

## Test generation
### Libraries
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/)

Although unused in this project, to employ the fallback strategy of computerized adaptive testing, I'd use the excellent [catsim](https://douglasrizzo.com.br/catsim/) library.

Code is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7.

### Metrics
